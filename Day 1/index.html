      JavaScript is a scripting language that allow you to create dynamically
      undating content, control multimedia,animate image etc. It is a
      interpreted language that means it doesn't need a compiler it executes
      instructions directly without compiling. JavaScript was invented by
      Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the
      ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA,
      the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox
      browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5.
